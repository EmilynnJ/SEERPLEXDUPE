## Core Data Models

### User Model
- Role-based differentiation (client, reader, admin) with specific fields per role
- Reader-specific fields:
  - Specialty categories (tarot, astrology, etc.)
  - Rate tiers for different session types (video, audio, chat)
  - Verification status and reader stats
- Client-specific fields: 
  - Balance for pay-per-minute sessions
  - Session history and favorites

### Session Model
- Pay-per-minute billing tracking with start/end timestamps
- Different rates per session type (video/audio/chat)
- Status transitions (pending, active, ended, cancelled)
- Revenue sharing calculations (70% reader, 30% platform)
- Links to transactions and messages within session

### Message Model
- Conversation tracking between clients and readers
- Message types (session, regular, system)
- Read status and delivery timestamps 
- Reactions and editing history

### Transaction Model
- Session billing records with per-minute charges
- Platform fee calculations and revenue splits
- Reader payout tracking and thresholds
- Client balance updates and refunds

### Domain-Specific Constraints
- Minimum session duration requirements
- Maximum session length limits
- Minimum reader payout threshold ($15.00)
- Reader rating thresholds for active status
- Cancellation and refund policies

### Relationships
- Sessions link clients and readers
- Messages belong to sessions or direct conversations
- Transactions reference sessions and users
- User reviews linked to completed sessions
