# session-billing-algorithm

Core implementation of the per-minute billing system for psychic reading sessions.

## Billing Logic

1. Rate Structure
- Video sessions: $3.99/minute 
- Audio sessions: $2.99/minute
- Chat sessions: $1.99/minute

2. Revenue Split
- Reader earnings: 70% of session cost
- Platform fee: 30% of session cost

3. Session Monitoring
- Balance checked every minute against session rate
- Session automatically terminated if client balance insufficient
- Minimum balance required: Cost of one minute at selected rate
- Transaction recorded for each successful charge

4. Charge Processing Flow
```
1. Validate sufficient client balance
2. Deduct rate from client balance
3. Split amount between reader (70%) and platform (30%)
4. Create transaction record
5. If insufficient funds:
   - End session
   - Update session status
   - Notify participants
```

## Session Duration Controls

1. Real-Time Balance Check
- Executed every 60 seconds
- Verifies client has funds for next minute
- Triggers session end if balance depleted

2. Session Limits
- Minimum duration: 1 minute
- Maximum duration: 120 minutes
- Early termination fee: None

## Revenue Calculation

1. Per-Session Revenue
- Total cost = minutes × rate
- Reader earnings = total cost × 0.70
- Platform fee = total cost × 0.30

2. Transaction Recording
- Timestamp of charge
- Amount charged
- Split amounts
- Session reference
- Participants

File paths:
- server/utils/billing.js
- server/routes/sessions.js
