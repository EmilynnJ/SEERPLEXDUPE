## Session Lifecycle Management (Importance: 95)
- Dual tracking system maps active sessions and participant connections:
  - `activeSessions`: Maintains session state and participant lists
  - `userSockets`: Links user IDs to WebSocket connections
- State transitions enforced through validation gates:
  - Pre-session: Reader availability and client balance verification
  - Active: Continuous participant presence monitoring
  - Termination: Automatic cleanup on participant departure

## Participant Management (Importance: 90)
- Business role enforcement (reader/client) with distinct permissions
- Reader-specific session controls:
  - Online status tracking integrated with session availability
  - Auto-accept configuration for incoming requests
  - Rate configuration by session type (video/audio/chat)
- Client validation:
  - Real-time balance verification
  - Single active session policy
  - Automatic termination on insufficient funds

## Session Types & Billing (Importance: 85)
- Multi-mode communication support:
  - Video: $3.99/min
  - Audio: $2.99/min
  - Chat: $1.99/min
- Real-time billing system:
  - Per-minute charges
  - 70/30 revenue split (reader/platform)
  - Balance monitoring with low-balance warnings
  - Automatic termination triggers

## Signaling Implementation (Importance: 80)
- Custom session coordination for psychic readings:
  - Offer/answer exchange with reading-specific metadata
  - ICE candidate distribution with role-based permissions
  - Session state broadcasting to participants
- Reader notification system:
  - Targeted delivery based on readerId
  - Availability status integration
  - Session request state tracking
