## Session Lifecycle Management (Importance: 95)

WebRTC session flow implements a specialized reading session state machine:

1. Session Establishment
- Reader availability verification pre-connection
- Balance validation ensuring minimum session duration capability
- Role-based connection authorization (reader vs client)
- Rate calculation based on selected modality (video/audio/chat)

2. Active Session Management
- Continuous participant tracking with dual mapping system:
  * activeSessions: sessionId → connected participants
  * userSockets: userId → socketId for direct targeting
- Real-time balance monitoring for automatic termination
- Reader revenue split tracking (70/30)
- Session state transitions: Pending → Active → Ended

3. Session Termination Conditions
- Insufficient client balance
- Reader disconnection
- Client disconnection
- Policy violations
- System maintenance
- Technical errors

## Participant Management (Importance: 85)

1. Reader Controls
- Online status tracking with timestamp updates
- Session acceptance workflow
- Rate management per modality
- Auto-cleanup on disconnection

2. Client Controls
- Balance verification per minute
- Session request initiation
- Modality selection validation
- Automatic termination notifications

## Business Rules (Importance: 90)

1. Session Validation
- Readers must maintain verified online status
- Clients restricted to single active/pending session
- Readers restricted to single active session
- Minimum balance requirement for initiation

2. Financial Controls
- Per-minute billing with real-time verification
- Automatic termination on insufficient funds
- Platform fee calculation (30%)
- Reader earnings tracking (70%)

3. State Management
- Force cleanup of abandoned sessions
- Participant tracking integrity
- Reader-specific notification routing
- Session membership validation
