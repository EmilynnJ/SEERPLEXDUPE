# session-billing-algorithm

Core session billing components handle the real-time monetization and revenue distribution of psychic reading sessions.

Key Workflows (Importance: 95):

1. Per-Minute Billing Engine:
- Calculates charges in real-time based on reader's rate per minute
- Automatically deducts from client balance at 60-second intervals
- Implements 70/30 revenue split between reader and platform
- Tracks cumulative session cost and duration
- Enforces minimum session length based on available client balance

2. Balance Verification System (Importance: 90):
- Pre-session validation ensures sufficient funds for minimum duration
- Continuous balance monitoring during active sessions
- Triggers automatic termination when balance falls below per-minute rate
- Updates client and reader balances in real-time
- Maintains transaction history with pre/post balance states

3. Revenue Distribution (Importance: 85):
- Calculates reader earnings at 70% of session revenue
- Tracks platform fee at 30% of total charges
- Maintains separate pending/paid balances for readers
- Processes automatic payouts when threshold reached ($15)
- Records detailed fee breakdown per transaction

4. Session State Management (Importance: 80):
- Pending -> Active -> Ended workflow
- Tracks billable vs non-billable time segments
- Handles mid-session rate changes
- Manages billing state during technical interruptions
- Generates financial summaries at session completion
